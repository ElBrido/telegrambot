# Bug Fix Summary - Missing Keys in check_card_status

## Problem Identified

The bot was experiencing `KeyError` exceptions when executing certain commands that rely on the `check_card_status()` function in `card_utils.py`. The following commands were affected:

1. `/ch` (Charge test command) - Line 205 in bot.py
2. `/vbv` (VBV/3D Secure verification) - Line 259 in bot.py
3. `/cardstatus` (Card active/inactive status) - Lines 311, 320 in bot.py

### Root Cause

The `check_card_status()` function was returning a dictionary that was missing two critical keys:
- `is_valid`: Boolean indicating whether the card passed Luhn validation
- `type`: String indicating the card brand (VISA, MASTERCARD, AMEX, etc.)

The bot code was attempting to access these keys directly (e.g., `result['is_valid']`), which caused `KeyError` exceptions when users tried to use the affected commands.

## Solution Implemented

Updated the `check_card_status()` function in `card_utils.py` to include the missing keys in all return scenarios:

### For Invalid Cards:
```python
return {
    "status": "INVALID",
    "message": "❌ Tarjeta inválida (no pasa validación Luhn)",
    "card": card_number,
    "is_valid": False,      # ← Added
    "type": "UNKNOWN"       # ← Added
}
```

### For Valid Cards:
```python
# Get card type from BIN
first_digit = card_number[0]
card_type = CardUtils.BIN_DATABASE.get(first_digit, {}).get("type", "UNKNOWN")

# ... status simulation ...

result["card"] = CardUtils.format_card_number(card_number)
result["is_valid"] = True    # ← Added
result["type"] = card_type   # ← Added

return result
```

## Benefits

1. **No More KeyError Exceptions**: All commands now work without runtime errors
2. **Consistent Data Structure**: All return paths from `check_card_status()` now have the same keys
3. **Proper Card Type Detection**: Card type is now automatically detected from the BIN (first digit)
4. **Better User Experience**: Commands like `/ch`, `/vbv`, and `/cardstatus` now display card type information

## Testing

All existing tests pass successfully:
- ✅ Card validation tests
- ✅ Card generation tests  
- ✅ BIN lookup tests
- ✅ Database operations tests
- ✅ Button handler tests

Additional verification confirmed:
- ✅ `/ch` command executes without errors
- ✅ `/vbv` command executes without errors
- ✅ `/cardstatus` command executes without errors
- ✅ Card type detection works for all brands (VISA, MASTERCARD, AMEX, DISCOVER)

## Files Modified

- `card_utils.py` (lines 134-164): Enhanced `check_card_status()` function

## Impact

**Before Fix:**
- Users attempting to use `/ch`, `/vbv`, or `/cardstatus` commands would encounter errors
- Bot console would show `KeyError: 'is_valid'` or similar exceptions

**After Fix:**
- All commands work smoothly
- Card type information is properly displayed
- No runtime errors

## Code Review

Code review was performed and optimization applied:
- Removed redundant empty string check (card_number is already validated)
