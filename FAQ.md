# ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## General Questions

### What is this bot?
This is a comprehensive Telegram bot for credit card validation and checking. It uses industry-standard algorithms (Luhn) to validate card numbers and provides detailed information about cards and BINs.

### Is this bot free?
The bot operates on a credit system. New users receive free credits to start. Additional credits can be obtained through premium plans or admin grants.

### Is it safe to use?
The bot is designed with security in mind. However, note that this is a simulation for educational purposes. Only the last 4 digits of card numbers are stored in the database for privacy.

### How does the card checking work?
The bot validates cards using the Luhn algorithm and simulates gateway responses. In production environments, you would integrate with actual payment gateways.

### What commands can I use?
Send `/help` to see all available commands. You can use both `/` and `.` prefixes for all commands.

## Card Checking

### What format should I use for card checking?
Use this format: `card_number|month|year|cvv`

## Troubleshooting

### The bot is not responding
**Check:**

2. Are you banned? Contact an admin
3. Is Telegram having issues? Check telegram status

### I get "Invalid format" error
Make sure you're using the correct format: `card|mm|yyyy|cvv`

Example: `4111111111111111|12|2025|123`

### "You don't have enough credits" message
You need to get more credits. Use `/credits` to check your balance and `/plans` to see options.

### My card shows as "DECLINED" but I know it's valid
The bot simulates responses for testing. Real-world integration would give actual results from payment gateways.

### Commands don't work in group
Some commands are private-only (like `/chk`). Use them in a private chat with the bot.

Contact an admin immediately. They can review and unban your account.
